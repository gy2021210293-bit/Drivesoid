# Drivesoid — Agent Setup Guide

This guide is written for AI agents performing an automated installation.
Follow each step in order. Ask the user only the questions listed below — nothing else.

---

## Step 1 — Environment check

**1a — Node.js**

Verify Node.js ≥ 18 is installed:
```
node --version
```
If missing, install from https://nodejs.org/

**1b — Port availability**

Drivesoid defaults to port 3001. Check whether it is already in use:
```
# Linux / macOS
lsof -i :3001

# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3001
```

If port 3001 is occupied, identify the process. If it is unrelated to Drivesoid, ask the user which port to use instead — then remember to set `server.port` in `drives.config.json` after setup.

**1c — Existing bridge or middleware**

Check whether the user already has an AI bridge or middleware running that sends messages to Claude or another model:

- Ask the user: *"Do you have an existing bridge, proxy, or middleware that routes your AI conversations? (e.g. a Node.js server, Python script, or self-hosted tool)"*
- If yes, note the language and entry point — you will need to add event-reporting calls to it in Step 6.
- If no, the Claude Code hook approach in Step 6 is the simplest path.

**1d — Clone target directory**

Choose where to install. Default is `~/Drivesoid`. Check the directory does not already exist:
```
ls ~/Drivesoid 2>/dev/null && echo "EXISTS" || echo "OK"
```
If it exists, ask the user whether to reinstall (delete and re-clone) or use a different path.

---

## Step 2 — Clone the repo

Use the install directory confirmed in Step 1d:
```
git clone https://github.com/A1batr055/Drivesoid.git <install-dir>
cd <install-dir>
npm install
```

---

## Step 3 — Run first-time setup via browser

Do NOT collect configuration through conversation.

**Note:** Setup always runs on port 3001. The service port also defaults to 3001. To use a different port, edit `server.port` in `drives.config.json` after completing setup, then restart.

1. Run `npm start`. If `drives.config.json` is missing or the API key is not set, Drivesoid starts in **setup mode** automatically and prints:
   ```
   [drives] First-time setup — open http://127.0.0.1:3001/setup
   ```

2. Tell the user:
   > "Please open **http://127.0.0.1:3001/setup** in your browser to complete setup. Fill in all fields and click Submit — I'll wait."

   **If the user is on a remote VPS with no local browser access**, they need an SSH tunnel first. Tell them to run this on their local machine (replace `user` and `vps-ip`):
   ```
   ssh -L 3001:localhost:3001 user@vps-ip
   ```
   Then open `http://127.0.0.1:3001/setup` in their local browser as normal.

3. Wait for the user to confirm they submitted the form, then stop the process (Ctrl+C).

The setup page collects persona name, user name, relationship, timezone, and API key. Everything is written to disk by the server — the user never needs to touch any files, and the API key does not pass through chat.

---

## Step 4 — Start the service

```
npm start
```

Drivesoid will load the config written by the setup page and start normally. Verify it started:
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:PORT/api/drives/status
```
Replace PORT with the service port (default 3001).
Expected: JSON with `snapshot_at`, `display`, `groups` fields. If `stale: true`, wait 30 seconds and retry.

---

## Step 5 — Keep it running in the background (optional but recommended)

`npm start` runs in the foreground — closing the terminal stops Drivesoid and drives go stale. To keep it alive automatically, use pm2:

**Install pm2 (one time):**
```
npm install -g pm2
```

**Start Drivesoid with pm2 (from the install directory):**
```
cd <install-dir>
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

**Make it restart automatically on reboot:**
```
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```
Run the command that `pm2 startup` prints (it will look like `sudo env PATH=...`).

**Useful commands:**
```
pm2 status          # check if running
pm2 logs drivesoid  # view logs
pm2 stop drivesoid  # stop it
pm2 restart drivesoid  # restart after config changes
```

If the user does not want to install pm2, they can leave `npm start` running in a terminal and skip this step.

---

## Step 6 — Integration

### 6a — Report events

Call these endpoints from your AI bridge so Drivesoid can track what's happening:

| When | Endpoint | Body |
|---|---|---|
| Session starts | `POST /internal/drives/session-start` | `{}` |
| User sends a message | `POST /internal/drives/event` | `{"type":"msg_user","payload":{"text":"<message>","context":[...]}}` |
| AI sends a reply | `POST /internal/drives/event` | `{"type":"msg_assistant","payload":{"message_id":"<id>"}}` |
| Quick reply detected | `POST /internal/drives/event` | `{"type":"msg_quick_reply"}` |
| User goes to sleep | `POST /internal/drives/sleep` | `{"type":"sleep_start"}` |
| User wakes up | `POST /internal/drives/sleep` | `{"type":"sleep_end"}` |

The `context` array in `msg_user` is optional but improves classification accuracy.
Format: `[{"role":"user","content":"..."},{"role":"assistant","content":"..."}]`

### 6b — Inject drives state into AI context

The AI needs to receive its current drives state each turn so it can reflect it in its persona.

**Option A — Claude Code hook (recommended for Claude Code users)**

Copy both hooks from this repo to your workspace:
```
mkdir -p <your-workspace>/.claude/hooks
cp hooks/UserPromptSubmit.sh <your-workspace>/.claude/hooks/UserPromptSubmit.sh
cp hooks/Stop.sh             <your-workspace>/.claude/hooks/Stop.sh
chmod +x <your-workspace>/.claude/hooks/UserPromptSubmit.sh
chmod +x <your-workspace>/.claude/hooks/Stop.sh
```

Enable hooks in your Claude Code settings (`.claude/settings.json`). **Paths must be absolute.** On Windows, prefix each command with `bash `:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{"matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "/absolute/path/to/.claude/hooks/UserPromptSubmit.sh"}]}],
    "Stop":             [{"matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "/absolute/path/to/.claude/hooks/Stop.sh"}]}]
  }
}
```

**Requirements:** Python 3 must be installed (used by both hooks). On Windows, hooks run inside Git Bash — install it from https://git-scm.com/ if not present, and use forward-slash paths. On macOS, install Python 3 via `brew install python3` if not already present.

`UserPromptSubmit` fires before each turn: it reports the user message to the classifier and injects a `[drives]` block as `additionalContext`:
```
[drives]
vitality 0.62  fatigue 0.18
longing 0.41  intimacy 0.68  possessiveness 0.33  lust 0.25
jealousy 0.10  anxiety 0.22  protectiveness 0.51
contentment 0.60  elation 0.38  seeking 0.47  play 0.44
dejection 0.09  irritability 0.14
```

`Stop` fires after each completed AI turn and records the assistant response as an event.

Add the `CLAUDE.md` file from this repo to your workspace (or paste its contents into your existing `CLAUDE.md`) so the AI persona understands what the `[drives]` block means.

**Option B — Custom bridge / middleware**

Before each Claude API call, fetch the formatted block from `GET /api/drives/context` and inject it as a system message:

```js
const ctx = await fetch('http://127.0.0.1:PORT/api/drives/context').then(r => r.text());
// empty string when state is stale — skip injection
if (ctx) messages.unshift({ role: 'system', content: ctx });
```

**Option C — OpenAI Codex CLI (≥ 0.141.0)**

Codex CLI has native lifecycle hooks. Copy the Python adapters and register them:

```
cp hooks/codex/UserPromptSubmit.py <your-codex-hooks-dir>/
cp hooks/codex/Stop.py             <your-codex-hooks-dir>/
```

Register in `~/.codex/hooks.json` (use `hooks/codex/hooks.json.example` as a template — replace the path placeholders with the absolute path to your Drivesoid install):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{"hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "python \"/path/to/drivesoid/hooks/codex/UserPromptSubmit.py\"", "timeout": 20, "statusMessage": "Loading Drivesoid state"}]}],
    "Stop":             [{"hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "python \"/path/to/drivesoid/hooks/codex/Stop.py\"", "timeout": 5, "statusMessage": "Reporting turn to Drivesoid"}]}]
  }
}
```

After saving, restart Codex and run `/hooks` to review and trust both commands.

The `UserPromptSubmit` adapter also handles service lifecycle: if Drivesoid is not running (e.g. after a reboot), it starts `node src/server.js` in the background automatically before the turn proceeds.

## Step 7 — Done

Tell the user:

> "Drivesoid is running. I can now track my emotional state across our conversations.
>
> You can view my emotional state and tune parameters anytime at:
> **http://127.0.0.1:PORT/dashboard**
> (replace PORT with the port number, default 3001)"
